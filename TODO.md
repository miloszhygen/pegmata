# TODO
- create the perfect gatsby setup with sanity inside the scaffolders folder
  - clean the one from Y-project
  - is it possible to create a sanity project without having to do a sanity init?
- add storybook to the project
- make some storybook and figma love
- improve the build script to scaffold the selected project type
  - we already have some logic for this
